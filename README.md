# simple sql diary

This is a simple way to get a sql database running in a flask app, which could then be put on a personal website if you're looking for database practice.

First run through the jupyter notebook cells, then declare the flask app like so:

`FLASK_APP=app.py flask run`

And you should have a very simple flask sql app up and running. Have fun!
